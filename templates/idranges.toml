# Length of integer IDs in vocabulary. IDs will be left-padded with zeros to specified length.
id_length = 8

# Section of IDranges for coordinating the allocation of numeric ID ranges to
# contributors for each vocabulary. Each idrange contains the same keys:
#
#   first_id = <int>              - first reserved integer ID in idrange
#   last_id = <int>               - last reserved integer ID in idrange
#   gh_username = "<string>"      - username on github
#   orcid = "<string>"            - contributor's ORCID, e.g. "0000-0001-2345-6789"
#   organisation_ror_id = "<url>" - ROR of home organisation, e.g. "https://ror.org/04fa4r544"
