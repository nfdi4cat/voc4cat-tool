                  integration in CI-pipelines. It is for example used to maintain
                  the SKOS vocabulary for catalysis "voc4cat" on GitHub
                  (nfdi4cat/voc4cat). Supported features include conversion between
                  SKOS/turtle and Excel/xlsx, validation, transformations between
                  different representations and documentation generation.},
