The SHACL profile came with merged vocexcel code (#119) and is early version from [vocpub](https://w3id.org/profile/vocpub);
based on the git history the exact version is [vocpub](https://github.com/AGLDWG/vocpub-profile/tree/c7ddb6256237451d59702ec9215dc343fd57ddb4)
which is an untagged version from 2021-10-20. In vocpub version numbers were only used from 3.0 onwards (from 2023-05-22) which is why we named the files here "pre3.0".
