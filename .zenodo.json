  "description": "<p>A command-line tool written in Python for creating and maintaining SKOS-vocabularies with Excel and GitHub. The voc4cat tool can be run locally but is also well suited for integration in CI-pipelines. It is for example used to maintain the SKOS vocabulary for catalysis <a href=\"https://github.com/nfdi4cat/voc4cat/\"><b>voc4cat</b></a> on GitHub.</p><p>Several features are included.</p><ul><li>Conversion between SKOS/turtle representation and Excel/xlsx. The conversion is supported in both directions.</li><li>Checking of vocabularies. This includes formal validation with SHACL-profiles but also additional checks useful for vocabulary maintenance.</li><li>Transforming of vocabularies between different RDF representations.</li><li>Documentation generation for publishing the vocabulary for example on GitHub pages.</li></ul>",
