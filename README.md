# SKOS vocabulary management with GitHub & Excel

## Overview

**[voc4cat](https://github.com/nfdi4cat/voc4cat)** is the vocabulary for catalysis developed in NFDI4Cat.

For voc4cat we developed a **toolbox for collaboratively maintaining SKOS vocabularies on github using Excel** (xlsx-files) as user-friendly interface. It consists of several parts:

- **voc4cat-tool** (this repository)
  - A command-line tool to convert vocabularies from Excel to SKOS (turtle/rdf) and validate the vocabulary. Validation includes formal validation with SHACL-profiles but also additional checks. The `voc4cat` tool can be run locally but is also well suited for integration in CI-pipelines. It was inspired by [RDFlib/VocExcel](https://github.com/nfdi4cat/VocExcel). Parts of the vocexccel code base were merged into this repository (see git history).
- **[voc4cat-template](https://github.com/nfdi4cat/voc4cat-template)**
  - A github project template for managing SKOS-vocabularies using a GitHub-based workflows including automation by gh-actions.
- **[voc4cat-playground](https://github.com/nfdi4cat/voc4cat-playground)**
  - A testbed for playing with the voc4cat workflow. The playground is a test-deployment of the voc4cat-template.
- **[voc4cat](https://github.com/nfdi4cat/voc4cat)**
  - A SKOS vocabulary for the catalysis disciplines that uses the voc4cat workflow for real work.

## Command-line tool voc4cat

To support what is not provided by the original VocExcel project we have developed this wrapper "voc4cat" that augments VocExcel with additional options like

- Checking our NFDI4Cat-Excel template
- Enriching our NFDI4Cat-Excel template (e.g. add IRIs)
- Processing all files in a folder at once
- Generating documentation (with [pyLODE](https://github.com/RDFLib/pyLODE) or [ontospy](http://lambdamusic.github.io/Ontospy/))
- Support for expressing concept-hierarchies by indentation.

Starting with v0.5.0 (July 2023) voc4cat uses its internal converter and does no longer depend on vocexcel ([PR #119](https://github.com/nfdi4cat/voc4cat-tool/pull/119)).

## Installation

To start you need:

- git
- Python (3.8 or newer)

voc4cat works on windows, linux and mac. However, the examples below assume that you work on windows
and that the [launcher](https://docs.python.org/3.11/using/windows.html#python-launcher-for-windows) is installed.
The launcher is included by default in Windows installers from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
If you don't have the launcher replace `py` by `python` (or `python3`, depending on your OS) in the commands below.

## Installation steps

Checkout this repository

`git clone https://github.com/nfdi4cat/voc4cat-tool.git`

Enter the directory to which you cloned.

`cd voc4cat-tool`

Create a virtual environment in a local subfolder ".venv" (This command is for windows. Replace "py" with "python3" on other platforms.):

`py -m venv .venv`

Activate the virtual environment (This is again for windows).

`.venv\scripts\activate.bat` (cmd) or `.venv\scripts\Activate.ps1` (powershell)

Update pip in the virtual environment.

`py -m pip install -U pip`

Install voc4cat into the virtual environment.

`pip install .`

To install including all development tools use `pip install .[dev]` for just the test tools us `pip install .[tests]`. For tests we use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org).

## Typical use

Show a help message for the voc4cat command line tool with all available options.

`voc4cat --help` (or simply `voc4cat`)

To create a new vocabulary use the voc4Cat-adjusted template from the `templates` subfolder.
You may first use simple temporary IRIs like (`ex:my_term`).

With voc4cat you can later replace all IDs belonging to a given prefix (here `ex`) by numeric IDs e.g. starting from 1001:

`voc4cat --make-ids temp 1001 --output-directory output example/photocatalysis_example_prelim-IDs.xlsx`

This will update all IRIs matching the `temp:`-prefix in the sheets "Concepts", "Additional Concept Features" and "Collections".

Manually filling the Children URI (in sheet "Concepts") and Members URI (in sheet "Collections") with lists of IRIs can be tedious.
An easier way to express hierarchies between concepts is to use indentation.
voc4Cat understands Excel-indentation (the default) for this purpose but can also work with other indentation formats (e.g. by 3 spaces per level).
voc4cat supports converting between indentation-based hierarchy and Children-URI hierarchy (both directions). For example, use

`voc4cat --hierarchy-from-indent --output-directory output example/photocatalysis_example_indented_prelim-IDs.xlsx`

or if you were using 3 spaces per level (this file does not exist)

`voc4cat --hierarchy-from-indent --indent-separator "   " --output-directory output example/photocatalysis_example_prelim-IDs_3spaces_indent.xlsx`

to convert to ChildrenURI-hierarchy. To create such a file you can convert from ChildrenURI-hierarchy to indentation by

`voc4cat --hierarchy-to-indent  --indent-separator "   " --output-directory output example/photocatalysis_example_prelim-IDs.xlsx`

Finally, the vocabulary file can be converted to turtle format. In this case the wrapper script forwards the job to VocExcel:

`voc4cat example/photocatalysis_example.xlsx`

A turtle file `photocatalysis_example.ttl` is created in the same directory where the xlsx-file is located.

The reverse is also possible. You can create an xlsx file from a turtle vocabulary file. Optionally a custom XLSX-template-file can be specified for this conversion:

`voc4cat --template template/VocExcel-template_043_4Cat.xlsx vocabulary.ttl`

Options that are specific for VocExcel can be put at the end of a `voc4cat` command.
Here is an example that forwards the `-e 3` and `-m 3` options to VocExcel and moreover demonstrates a complex combination of options:

`voc4cat --check --forward --docs pylode --output-directory outbox inbox-excel-vocabs/ -e 3 -m 3`

Besides `voc4cat` this project also installs its own version of the `vocexcel` command line tool (for historic reasons). Its use is deprecated in version 0.5.0 and it will be removed in version 0.6.0.
