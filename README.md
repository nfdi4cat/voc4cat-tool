# SKOS vocabulary management with GitHub & Excel

## Overview

For **[voc4cat](https://github.com/nfdi4cat/voc4cat)**, a term collection for catalysis created in [NFDI4Cat](https://www.nfdi4cat.org), we developed a **toolbox for collaboratively maintaining SKOS vocabularies on GitHub using Excel** (xlsx-files) as user-friendly interface. It consists of several parts:

- **voc4cat-tool** (this package)
  - A command-line tool to convert vocabularies from Excel to SKOS (turtle/rdf) and validate the vocabulary. Validation includes formal validation with SHACL-profiles but also additional checks. The `voc4cat` tool can be run locally but is also well suited for integration in CI-pipelines. It was inspired by [RDFlib/VocExcel](https://github.com/nfdi4cat/VocExcel). Parts of the vocexcel code base were merged into this repository (see git history).
- **[voc4cat-template](https://github.com/nfdi4cat/voc4cat-template)**
  - A github project template for managing SKOS-vocabularies using a GitHub-based workflows including automation by gh-actions.
- **[voc4cat-playground](https://github.com/nfdi4cat/voc4cat-playground)**
  - A testbed for playing with the voc4cat workflow. The playground is a test-deployment of the voc4cat-template.
- **[voc4cat](https://github.com/nfdi4cat/voc4cat)**
  - A SKOS vocabulary for the catalysis disciplines that uses the voc4cat workflow for real work.

## Command-line tool voc4cat

voc4cat was mainly developed to be used in gh-actions but it is also useful as a locally installed command line tool. It has the following features.

- Convert between SKOS-vocabularies in Excel/xlsx format and rdf-format (turtle) in both directions.
- Check/validate SKOS-vocabularies in rdf/turtle format with the [vocpub](https://w3id.org/profile/vocpub) SHACL-profile.
- Use a vocabulary-configuration file to specify for example ID ranges for each contributor.
- Check xlsx vocabulary files for errors or incorrect use of IDs (voc4cat uses pydantic for this validation)
- Generate documentation from SKOS/turtle vocabulary file using [pyLODE](https://github.com/RDFLib/pyLODE) (or [ontospy](http://lambdamusic.github.io/Ontospy/))
- Express concept-hierarchies in xlsx by indentation.
- Consistently update all IRIs in the xlsx vocabulary (e.g. with new namespace or IDs)

voc4cat works on files or folders. If a folder is given all matching files are processed at once.

### Installation requirements

To start you need:

- Python (3.8 or newer)

voc4cat is platform independent and should work at least on windows, linux and mac.

### Installation steps

If you just want to use the command line interface it is strongly suggested to use [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) for the installation. `pipx` makes installing and managing python command line application very easy.

`pipx install voc4cat`

Alternatively you can `pip`-install voc4cat like any other Python package.
To install including all development tools use `pip install .[dev]` for just the test tools `pip install .[tests]`. For tests we use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org).

### Typical use

The available commands and options can be explored via the help system:

`voc4cat --help` (or simply `voc4cat`)

which lists all available sub commands. These have their own help, for example:

`voc4cat transform --help`

To create a new vocabulary use the voc4cat-adjusted template from the `templates` subfolder.
For starting you can use simple temporary IRIs like (`ex:my_term`) for your concepts.
With voc4cat you can later replace these later by different namespaces and/or different numeric IDs.

The files used below to demonstrate some commands can be found in the example folder of the [repository](https://github.com/nfdi4cat/voc4cat-tool/).

For expressing hierarchies in SKOS ("broader"/"narrower") voc4cat offers two options. One way is to enter a list of children IRIs  (in sheet "Concepts"). However, filling the Children URI columns with lists of IRIs can be tedious. Therefore, voc4cat offers a second easier way to express hierarchies between concepts and that is by indentation. voc4Cat understands Excel-indentation (the default) but can also work with other indentation formats (e.g. 3 spaces per level). To switch between the two representations, use the `transform` sub-command. For example, use

`voc4cat transform --from-indent --outdir outbox example/photocatalysis_example_indented_prelim-IDs.xlsx`

or if you were using 3 spaces per level (This file does not yet exist.)

`voc4cat transform --from-indent --indent "   " --inplace outbox outbox\photocatalysis_example_prelim-IDs.xlsx`

to convert to ChildrenURI-hierarchy. To create such a file convert for example from ChildrenURI-hierarchy to indentation by

`voc4cat transform --to-indent --indent "   " --outdir outbox example/photocatalysis_example_prelim-IDs.xlsx`

As mentioned above, you can replace all IDs belonging to a given prefix (here `temp`) by numeric IDs e.g. starting from 1001:

`voc4cat transform --make-ids temp 1001 --outdir outbox example/photocatalysis_example_prelim-IDs.xlsx`

This will consistently update all IRIs matching the `temp:`-prefix in the sheets "Concepts", "Additional Concept Features" and "Collections".

Finally, the vocabulary file can be converted from xlsx to SKOS/turtle format.

`voc4cat convert example/photocatalysis_example.xlsx`

A turtle file `photocatalysis_example.ttl` is created in the same directory where the xlsx-file is located.

The reverse is also possible. You can create an xlsx file from a turtle vocabulary file.
Optionally a custom XLSX-template-file can be specified for this conversion:

`voc4cat convert -O outbox --template templates/voc4cat_template_043.xlsx example/photocatalysis_example.ttl`

In addition to `transform` and `convert` voc4cat offers checking and validation under the sub-command `check` and documentation generation under `docs`.
See the command line help for details.
